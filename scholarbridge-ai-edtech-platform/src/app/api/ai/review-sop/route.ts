### ✅ What Works Well
1. **Clear Academic Progression:** Demonstrates logical sequence from undergraduate coursework to graduate aspirations.
2. **Technical Vocabulary:** Effectively incorporates domain-specific terms relevant to **${targetMajor || "your target field"}**.
3. **Professional Tone:** Avoids overly casual language and maintains an articulate, confident posture throughout.

---

### ⚠️ Critical Areas for Improvement
1. **Deeper Institutional Customization:** Mention specific professors, recent research papers, or exact specialized elective courses at **${targetUniversity || "your target university"}**.
2. **Quantify Project Impact:** Replace vague statements like "I achieved great results" with concrete metrics (e.g., *"improved model efficiency by 34%"* or *"managed a team of 5 developers"*).
3. **Sharpen the Opening Hook:** Transform the introductory sentence into a memorable personal narrative rather than a generic statement.
